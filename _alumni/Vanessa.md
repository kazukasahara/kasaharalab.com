description: "Vanessa graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Biological Chemistry. Since she was young, she has been interested in various skin conditions, such as acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, and skin aging. One of her dreams is to eventually explore the role of the gut microbiome in these skin conditions. Vanessa is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in skin aging at Professor Maurice's lab from NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. Her lab rotation is at the Kasahara lab, where she learns how to culture anaerobic gut microbes. In her free time, Vanessa enjoys watching drama and playing with her two bunnies at home!"
