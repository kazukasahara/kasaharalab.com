description: "Im Mai, currently a Year 3 Biological Sciences at NTU doing FYP at Kasahara lab. My interest in the lab started after i took Microbiology and 
I was intrigued at the interlink between diet, gut microbiome and human health. Besides enjoying working in the lab during weekdays, I love cooking and 
watching movies!"
