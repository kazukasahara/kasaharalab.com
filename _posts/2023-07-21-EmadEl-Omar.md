On July 21, 2023, we had the honor of hosting Professor Emad El-Omar, a distinguished figure in the field of Medicine and a Professor 
at the St George and Sutherland Clinical Campuses, UNSW Australia. Professor El-Omar also holds the esteemed position of Director at 
the UNSW Microbiome Research Centre at St George Hospital, and he serves as the Editor in Chief of the renowned journal "Gut."

During his visit, we had the opportunity to showcase our Microbiome Centre and engage in a fruitful exchange of ideas and 
discussions. The meeting was a valuable platform for sharing insights and expertise in the field.
