Dr. Henning Seedorf, who serves as the Principal Investigator at Temasek Life Sciences, extended an invitation to Dr. Federico Rey 
for the TLL 20th Anniversary Symposium. Interestingly, Henning and Federico had previously been colleagues in the lab of Prof. 
Jeffrey Gordon at Washington University in St. Louis. Furthermore, during Kazu's postdoctoral days at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, Federico had acted as his mentor.. It's truly a remarkable series of connections. Both Henning and Kazu were 
delighted to have the chance to reunite with Federico.
