We were fortunate to have the valuable opportunity to attend a seminar by Prof. Ramnik Xavier at NUS. Prof. Xavier holds a 
significant role as a core institute member at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He not only serves as the director of the 
Klarman Cell Observatory but also holds the positions of director for the Broad’s Immunology Program and co-director for the Broad’s 
Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program.
