We went on a business trip to Shenzhen with A/Prof Andrew Tan's, A/Prof Sunny Wong's, and Asst Prof Jue Tao Lim's teams. On the first day, we visited Dr. Ho Chun Loong's lab at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Institute of Synthetic Biology, where we toured the facilities and had research discussions. On the second and third days, we held a joint symposium between SUSTech and NTU/LKC, hosted by Asst Prof Li Liang at SUSTech. Additionally, we visited the BGI headquarters in Shenzhen for research sharing and discussions.
