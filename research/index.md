# Our research
<br>
## Metabolic, Nutrition and Microbiome Medicine Laboratory

Human studies have revealed consistent alterations in the gut microbiomes of patients with cardiometabolic and aging-associated diseases. A major focus of our group is to understand how variations in the gut microbiome modulate the effects of diet and hostâ€™s susceptibility to cardiometabolic disease. In the Kasahara laboratory at LKCMedicine, Nanyang Technological University, we are applying experimental and computational tools to understand the interactions between diet, the microbiota, and human health with an emphasis on cardiometabolic disorders including metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis.
